# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn by comparing two machine learning approaches: an XGBoost model and a Logistic Regression model. The workflow includes data loading, cleaning and preprocessing, balancing the dataset, hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation for XGBoost, model training and evaluation, and finally generating predictions for unseen test data. Insights from the performance metrics (AUC) of both models inform the selection of the final predictive model for submission.
